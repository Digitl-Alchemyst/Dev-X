## Reflections and Notes

Was kind of a crappy day. Started off with my son missing bus which rolled into wife late getting other son to school, which made her late getting back which made us miss the first kids school play. so everything was downhill after that kind of down over missing it. Got a lot of adult bs done today and out the way so there is that.
