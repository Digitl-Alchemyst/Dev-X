Challenge: Convert a callback-based function to use Promises instead.

Day 4: Introduction to Async/Await

Challenge: Refactor a Promise-based function to use async/await syntax.

Day 5: Error Handling Across Different Patterns

Challenge: Implement error handling for the same functionality using callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

Day 6: Parallel vs Sequential Execution

Challenge: Create functions that demonstrate the difference between running asynchronous tasks in parallel vs sequentially.

Day 7: Real-world API Integration

Challenge: Build a simple weather dashboard that fetches data from a public API using async/await.

Week 2: Deep Dive into Callbacks
Day 1: Callback Fundamentals

Challenge: Create a utility library with functions that accept callbacks for array transformations.

Day 2: Callback Hell

Challenge: Experience and then refactor a "callback hell" scenario with multiple nested operations.

Day 3: Callback Parameters and Patterns

Challenge: Implement the Node.js error-first callback pattern in a file processing utility.

Day 4: Control Flow with Callbacks

Challenge: Build a task manager that executes callbacks in a specific order with dependencies.

Day 5: Throttling and Debouncing

Challenge: Implement throttle and debounce functions that use callbacks to control execution frequency.

Day 6: Custom Event System

Challenge: Create a simple event emitter that registers callback functions and triggers them on events.

Day 7: Callback-based Animation

Challenge: Build a simple animation system using requestAnimationFrame with callback functions.

Week 3: Mastering Promises
Day 1: Promise Fundamentals

Challenge: Create custom Promise implementations for common asynchronous operations.

Day 2: Promise Chaining

Challenge: Build a multi-step data processing pipeline using Promise chaining.

Day 3: Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.any, Promise.allSettled

Challenge: Implement scenarios where each Promise combinator is the optimal choice.

Day 4: Promisification

Challenge: Create a utility that converts callback-based APIs to Promise-based APIs.

Day 5: Advanced Error Handling with Promises

Challenge: Build a robust error handling system with custom error types and recovery strategies.

Day 6: Promise Patterns and Anti-patterns

Challenge: Identify and fix common Promise anti-patterns in a provided codebase.

Day 7: Building a Promise-based API

Challenge: Develop a client library for a REST API using Promises.

Week 4: Advanced Async/Await Patterns
Day 1: Async/Await Fundamentals

Challenge: Convert a complex Promise chain to use async/await syntax.

Day 2: Error Handling with Async/Await

Challenge: Implement try/catch patterns and compare with Promise-based error handling.

Day 3: Async Iteration

Challenge: Build a paginated data fetcher that uses async iterators and for-await-of loops.

Day 4: Concurrent Execution with Async/Await

Challenge: Optimize a data processing application by handling concurrent operations with async/await.

Day 5: Timeouts and Cancellation

Challenge: Implement timeout and cancellation patterns for async/await operations.

Day 6: Testing Asynchronous Code

Challenge: Write tests for asynchronous code using Jest and React Testing Library.

Day 7: Final Project: Async State Management

Challenge: Build a custom async state management solution for a React application that handles loading, error, and success states.
