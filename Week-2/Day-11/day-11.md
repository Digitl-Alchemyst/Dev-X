## Reflections and Notes

First real day back on it, started working on the feature last night got super stuck on a bug, but got it working today. This was a true vibe coding experience. I had no idea how to approach something like this. Couldnt find any information on doing something like this either. But AI pulled through and showed me the way. The code was clean and easy to work with so I am getting an understanding of how it all works under the hood
